1.2) The best case runtime complexity would be O(n). The best case input would be a list that was already sorted.
1.3) The worst case runtime complexity would be O(n^2). The worst case input would be a list that was sorted in reverse order.

2.2) The worst case runtime complexity would be O(n^2).

3.2) The worst case runtime complexity would be O(n^2).

4.2) The worst case runtime complexity would be O(nlogn).

5.2) The best case runtime complexity of SummerSort is O(n^2). The best case input would be if the list was sorted from least to greatest.
5.3)The worst case runtime complexity would also be O(n^2). The worst case input would be if the list was sorted from greatest to least.

6.2) The best case runtime complexity would be O(nlogn).
