Question 6 Answer:

	This is possible, because big-Oh is an asymptotic measure of performance - it gives only the rate of growth, once n is sufficiently large. Given functions f(n) and g(n), we say that f(n) is O(g(n)) if there are positive constants c and n0 such that f(n) <= cg(n) for n >= n0. The values of c and k must be fixed for function f and must not depend on n. 
	Say you want to compare Insertion Sort (an O(n2) algorithm) with Quick Sort (an O(nlogn) algorithm). We know from empirical evidence that Insertion Sort is faster than Quick Sort when n is small (smallness can depend). Thatâ€™s why optimized Quick Sort implementations switch to Insertion Sort when the subarray is less than 10 or so items.
